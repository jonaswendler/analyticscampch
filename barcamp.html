        <h2 class="guide-title-event">AnalyticsCamp Switzerland is about you!</h2>
        <div href="" class="event-rich-text w-richtext">
          <p>You can either just spend some time with colleagues and friends at the Barcamp. Network – so to speak. Or you can hold a session yourself, help out, interact, share or develop something new. As said, there will be no predefined agenda with set speakers. The schedule/sessions will be curated by all attendees of the AnalyticsCamp.
          <br>
          <br>
          In other words, you can do as you please. Of course, there are some rules, but you do not have to do anything. You are free to choose the topics you like, the sessions you want to participate in or to leave a discussion if it is not fruitful for you. It is an opportunity for you to talk to people you might not usually meet or talk about things you could not do at your current job. Learn, share, network, and – most importantly – have fun!
          <br>
          <br>
          You bring your ideas, thoughts, and knowledge – it is about the exchange. Yes, it sounds a bit unconventional, but that is exactly the point. If you are still unsure about the event or have other questions, please <a href="/contact.html">reach out</a> and let us know.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h4>Sessions?! What is a session?</h4>
        <div href="" class="event-rich-text">
          <p>We have no idea. Actually, this is partly true. A session can be anything you want, as long as it is beneficial to you and/or other participants.
          <br>
          <br>
          Though, there are some guidelines. A session is usually 45 minutes long so you have 15 mins to network or get a coffee. If you need more time you can call an ad-hoc session, for instance in the common area or a room if there are still some empty slots. Common sessions include presentations, discussions, workshops, an open question or some more hands-on activities. But, as said, you can do whatever you want. Make a dance about all the Digital Analytics tools. We are not kidding. If it is of interest to you and other participants, please go ahead.
          <br>
          <br>
          The session will be planned in the morning. You have to present your topic of interest or the thing you want to share to the other participants (kind of like a pitch). If people are interested we will then find a time slot and a room for you to hold the session in. Please put your topic, type of session (e.g. discussion or workshop), name and possibly some contact info like your Twitter name on the session sheet.
          <br>
          <br>
          Some of you might be scared to present something. Please don’t be. Usually, people say that nobody will bite you. But we can’t promise that. We hope there will be enough food. Though, you never know. However, the AnalyticsCamp is an open environment with no hierarchy or other things, so we truly welcome anybody to share their thoughts and propose sessions.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h4>What to wear?</h4>
        <div href="" class="event-rich-text">
          <p>Some BarCamps actually prohibit business attire like suits and ties. We do not. Come as you are or as you're most comfortable. Well, at least have some pants and a shirt on. But otherwise, we do not care. You can come in shorts and t-shirt, or like it’s a formal white-tie event. As long as you are comfortable, we are happy.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h4>Personal Experience</h4>
        <div href="" class="event-rich-text">
          <p>The AnalyticsCamp Switzerland, like most Barcamps, is an open, informal event. Hence, there is no hierarchy, nor formality. We encourage you to use the informal ‘you’ instead of addressing people in a formal manner – the German ‘Sie’.
          <br>
          <br>
          We encourage you to actively engage and interact with other people (if you like), so you get the most out of the event. The AnalyticsCamp should be a fun experience for you.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h4>Social & Online Media</h4>
        <div href="" class="event-rich-text">
          <p>At the AnalyticsCamp we encourage knowledge sharing. The same goes for the Internet (yes, it’s most likely going to stay). Please do share tweets, posts, or blog posts – from us (of course), but most importantly your experience, fellow participants, and interested folks. We also encourage you to share your thoughts and posts with us so we can feature them, learn and share.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h4>Public Sphere</h4>
        <div href="" class="event-rich-text">
          <p>The AnalyticsCamp is an open, public unconference. Thus, some pictures and maybe even videos will be taken. Possibly they will also be shared on the internet. If you are not comfortable with this at all, we rather advise you to not come, as we cannot control this. However, we honor privacy as much as possible. If you do not want to be included in a photograph please tell people so. Sometimes participants of events put a sticker/badge on to signal that.
          <br>
          <br>
          Though - and we do want to stress that -  DO NOT take pictures of children in case there are any around – unless parents explicitly tell you that it is ok.
          <br>
          <br>
          Our apologies for being so strict. This is an Analytics BarCamp, so it should be clear anyway. But still, have fun (that's an order)!
